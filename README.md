## What is Caluma?

You have a process which is done manually or even on paper and you want to move into the digital world.

Your process has the following characteristics:

* Centered around a form (e.g. application, certification, ...)
* Different users involved
* Specific flow how a form is processed

While Caluma can be used to model complex form based business processes, let's make a
simple example.

1. End user submits application
2. Case worker makes initial assessment
3. Case worker forwards application to responsible specialists
4. Specialists provide feedback
5. Case worker summarizes feedback and responds to end user

Caluma provides first class support for such use cases by providing a service that allows you to:

* Dynamically create complex forms
* Define fine-grained permissions on form
* Implement declarative business process
